# Mockups
Repo for mockups for group 18's HCI project

# Info
Mockups are done in Balsamic, and are created in order to evaluate our proposed UI with our target audience

# Collaboration
0. Open a terminal (CMD, bash, etc) window and cd to the directory you want this project to be in (eg: School/CS4063/Group-Project)
1. Download (clone) this repo to your local machine (git clone https://github.com/OU-HCI-18/mockups/), and cd to it (cd mockups)
2. Make changes! As you go, do the following two steps:
3. Add changes to your local staging area (git add filename)
4. Commit them (git commit commit-message). Make sure the commit message is helpful and informative
5. Commit often!!!
6. When you're ready to share your work, push the changes (git push)
7. To see what others have done, pull the latest from the remote repo (git pull)

You may need to do more complicated things (branching, merging). For this project, that's kind of hard,
because balsamic wireframes isn't the best usecase for git's style of version control, so just make sure you have the remote changes
(git pull) before you start working on anything, and you (shouldn't) have any problems.
